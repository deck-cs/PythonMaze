# Assignment

1. An analysis of the maze generation code should be done.
2. The code must be changed so that the output becomes:
   grid = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
   [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
   [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
   [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
   [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
   [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]]
3. 6 mazes shall be made, the sizes of which shall be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30.
4. An analysis of the maze solution code should be done.
5. A counter must be entered into the program indicating where
   many points that have been visited.
6. Put in a timer that measures the time it takes to solve a maze.
7. Solve the 6 maze sizes 10 times and calculate the average value.
   The above should be used to make the following plot when we come to lesson 5.
   _(See pictures in PDF)_
8. Both the maze generation and the solution must be inserted into your model in your
   MVC and view must be able to take the maze size and ? as input and return the time
   and number of points visited and ?
   The insertion must take into account that more generation and solution algorithms can
   be used.
   Optional.
   You can make an A \* algorithm and test it against the recursive solution.
   The assignment must be completed within 2 weeks and must be completed with your
   review group. Of course, it must be approved by me after.
